## JInventory

The [JInventory](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JInventory) is the main abstraction layer for any block entity that will have inventories in themselves. This library has 8 classes and 3 interfaces.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
  :bulb:<strong>Remember</strong>, the easiest way to use the library is to extend the block entity from <strong>AbstractInventoryBE</strong> and if you need extra functionality on top of that, you can implement the IInventory interface. Also, you should take not of the <strong>OutputSlot</strong> and <strong>PredicateSlot</strong>.
