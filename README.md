# Ji Libs

This is the wiki pages for all of my library system developed for Fabric MC Modding. I call the collection JiLibs but they are modular libraries that can be used separately (with some of them depending on others) or side by side each other in a project.

These libraries include:

- Ji Logger: A wrapper library around logging system provided by minecraft. This wrapper and it's helper methods lets you log information with more style flexibility and with ease.
- Ji Register: This library is all about registring Items, Blocks, and other entries into Minecraft Registry System.
- Ji Config: A wrapper library around [Simple Config]() with more flexibility and more methods that will let you fully customize the look of your config ini files for your mod.
- Ji Reference: This library is the main reference for most of my mods. It will produce some base methods like translate, and identifier that I use in almost all of the mods I develop.
- Jira Lib: This library adds the base abstraction layer for most of the mods I develop.
- Ji Inventory: As the name suggests, this library is a wrapper around the Item Inventory API provided by fabric for Minecraft Modding.
- Ji Fluid: The wrapper around the fluid API provided by fabric for Minecraft Modding.
- Ji Energy: The wrapper around the Energy API provided by Tech Reborn Team for Fabric MC
- Ji Machina: This library uses the wrappers provided by JInventory, JiFluid, and JiEnergy to add more abstraction on top for most of the advanced block entity use cases.
