# Ji Libs

This is the wiki pages for all of my library system developed for Fabric MC Modding. I call the collection JiLibs but they are modular libraries that can be used separately (with some of them depending on others) or side by side each other in a project.

These libraries include:

- [Ji Logger](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiLogger): A wrapper library around logging system provided by minecraft. This wrapper and it's helper methods lets you log information with more style flexibility and with ease.
- [Ji Register](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiRegister): This library is all about registring Items, Blocks, and other entries into Minecraft Registry System.
- [Ji Config](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiConfig): A wrapper library around [Simple Config](https://github.com/magistermaks/fabric-simplelibs) with more flexibility and more methods that will let you fully customize the look of your config ini files for your mod.
- [Ji Reference](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiReference): This library is the main reference for most of my mods. It will produce some base methods like translate, and identifier that I use in almost all of the mods I develop.
- [Jira Lib](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiraLib): This library adds the base abstraction layer for most of the mods I develop.
- [JInventory](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JInventory): As the name suggests, this library is a wrapper around the Item Inventory API provided by fabric for Minecraft Modding.
- [Ji Fluid](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiFluid): The wrapper around the fluid API provided by fabric for Minecraft Modding.
- [Ji Energy](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiEnergy): The wrapper around the Energy API provided by Tech Reborn Team for Fabric MC
- [Ji Machina](https://github.com/drkhodakarami/JiMachina): This library uses the wrappers provided by JInventory, JiFluid, and JiEnergy to add more abstraction on top for most of the advanced block entity use cases.
